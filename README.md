AutoItScripts
=============

Some Windows AutoIt scripts to auto some admin jobs.

Just found these scripts in an old drive. Although I don't work much on Windows machine nowadays, think it might help others to auto theirs admin jobs on windows.
I tested them on Windows 7.

Basically, they are to create/delete/show windows users, launch software and input serial numbers. These scripts can relieve you from these repeated boring jobs. All you need to to is clicking mouse while enjoying your tea.
