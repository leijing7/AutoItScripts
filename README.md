AutoItScripts
=============

Some Windows AutoIt scripts to auto admin jobs.

Just found these scripts in my old drive. I wrote them about 2 yrs ago. Although I don't work much on Windows machine nowadays, think it might help others to auto theirs admin jobs on windows.

I tested them on Windows 7.

Basically, they are to create/delete/show windows users, launch software and input serial numbers. If you did this kinds of thing for lots of PCs, you would know why I developed them. These scripts can relieve you from these repeated boring tasks. All you need to to is clicking mouse while enjoying your tea/coffee/chai.

1. createUserAccount.au3

  This script will create a user account with the password specified for you. It has a Gui to help you to input the information.

2. deleteUserAccount.au3
  
  This script doesn't have a gui. So you need to change the script to suit your needs.

3.showUserAccounts.au3

  It has a Gui to show all the user accounts the PC has. You can use this to check the previous scripts working.
  
4. launchAdobe.au3

  This is to show how to launch a software in you machine via AutoIt. The demo will launch Adobe if it exists.
  
5. inputAdobeSerialNumber.au3

  This shows how to input the serial numbe when the serial number window pops up. Just replace the * asterisk with real number.
  
6. inputAdobeSigninInfo.au3
  
  It will auto input the signin information (email and password) in the popped up signin window.
