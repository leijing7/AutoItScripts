AutoItScripts
=============

Some Windows AutoIt scripts to auto admin jobs.

Just found these scripts in my old drive. I wrote them about 2 yrs ago. Although I don't work much on Windows machine nowadays, think it might help others to auto theirs admin jobs on windows.

I tested them on Windows 7.

Basically, they are to create/delete/show windows users, launch software and input serial numbers. If you did this kinds of thing for lots of PCs, you would know why I developed them. These scripts can relieve you from these repeated boring tasks. All you need to to is clicking mouse while enjoying your tea/coffee/char.
